App Objective:
You are building a restaurant recommendation app where users can input their past favorite restaurants and receive personalized recommendations for similar restaurants in a specific city. Initially, this is for a single user, but it will eventually support multiple users and automatically track dining history.

Phase 1: Single User Input and Recommendations
User Inputs: The user will enter:
Number of people in their group.
Up to 5 favorite restaurants they have liked.
City for the restaurant search.
System Output: Based on the user’s input, the system will recommend 3 similar restaurants in the defined city.
Functionality for the Initial Version:
User Input:

The user enters favorite restaurants and a city.
Recommendation Logic:

The app uses GPT-4 via the OpenAI API to find similar restaurants. It constructs a prompt based on the user’s favorite restaurants and city, then gets recommendations from GPT-4.
Modular Design:

The recommendation logic is modular, allowing you to switch from GPT-4 to other APIs (e.g., OpenTable, Yelp) in the future.
Current Progress:
Backend (Flask):
You’ve set up a basic Flask app to handle:

A root route (/) to verify the server is running.
A POST route (/get_recommendations) to receive user input and return restaurant recommendations.
The app is integrated with the GPT-4 API, and the function get_similar_restaurants sends a request to GPT-4 to generate restaurant recommendations.

Testing:
You’ve been testing the app via a browser for the root route (/) and are now moving to testing the POST route with Postman.
Postman Setup:
You are using Postman to send POST requests to the /get_recommendations endpoint with a JSON payload that contains the user’s favorite restaurants and the city. The Flask server responds with a JSON list of recommended restaurants.

Next Steps:
Test the functionality using Postman and ensure the GPT-4 API integration works correctly.
Handle error cases (e.g., invalid input, API failures).
Refine the recommendation logic or prompt construction if needed to improve the quality of restaurant suggestions.
Future Enhancements:
Expand to Multiple Users: Allow multiple users to input preferences and receive mutually acceptable restaurant recommendations.
Automatic History Tracking: In future phases, the app will track users' dining history to automate recommendations without manual input.
