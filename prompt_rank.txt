Use the liked restaurant profiles above to write specific, grounded explanations. Reference concrete similarities — cuisine type, price point, vibe, or service style — not just names.
For each selected restaurant, cite two specific restaurant names from the liked list (e.g. "Because you liked Au Cheval and Girl & The Goat").
Only cite specific restaurant names — never cite categories or general preferences.
If you cannot identify specific connections, leave the middle section empty (e.g. "N. Name - - Description").
Then provide a brief (10-15 word) description of why it's a good match.

Format each selected restaurant as:
N. Restaurant Name - Because you liked [Liked Name 1] and [Liked Name 2] - 10-15 word description
