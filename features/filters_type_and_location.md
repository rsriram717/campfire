There should be a filter for type of restaurant that's recommended. The filters allowed are casual, sit-down, bar. They are checkboxes and a user can pick up to all 3 or none. When recommendations are generated, they must fit the filter selected. If none of these checkboxes are selected, assume no additional filtering is required. 

There should also be a text field next to city called "Neighborhood" where someone can input a neighborhood. This should be taken into the prompt as well, and the restaurants suggested should conform to the neighborhood. This filtering can be done directly through the prompt - no additional filtering need be done on the backend.
