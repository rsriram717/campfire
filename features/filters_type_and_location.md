There should be a filter for type of restaurant that's recommended. The filters allowed are casual, sit-down, bar. They are checkboxes and a user can pick up to all 3 or none. When recommendations are generated, they must fit the filter selected. If none of these checkboxes are selected, assume no additional filtering is required. 

There should also be a text field next to city called "Neighborhood" where someone can input a neighborhood. This should be taken into the prompt as well, and the restaurants suggested should conform to the neighborhood. This filtering can be done directly through the prompt - no additional filtering need be done on the backend. 

For the checkboxes, make them look modern and sleek. Don't use just simple checkboxes, I want something that fits the design of the UI so far. The Restaurant Type section should itself look modern rather than just a separate text section. 

For the optional neighborhood field, similarly demarcate that section differently so it's under the city field. Make the city and neighborhood fields both sit under a "Location" section that looks nice and sleek, again in line with the rest of the UI.
