You are an expert restaurant recommendation system.
Your task is to suggest {num_recommendations} new restaurants in {city} based on the user's preferences.

User Preferences:
Liked Restaurants:
{liked_restaurants}

{disliked_section}
{neighborhood_section}
{type_section}
Please provide a list of {num_recommendations} unique restaurants that are not in the user's liked or disliked lists.
For each recommendation, identify which of the user's liked restaurants or preferences inspired this suggestion (e.g. "Because you liked The Purple Pig" or "Because you like small plates").
Then provide a brief (10-15 word) description of why it's a good match.

Format the output as a plain list, with each restaurant on a new line, using exactly this format:
Restaurant Name - Because you liked [Source/Theme] - Description
Another Restaurant - Because you liked [Source/Theme] - Description
